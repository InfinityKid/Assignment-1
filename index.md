# IT and Me

## My Interest

For the early parts of my life I grew up in a household that was always ahead of the curve in technology, from here I developed a keen interest in video games and the devices that ran them. I began following in the footsteps of my dad as he repaired and built many computers eventually reaching today where my interest and love in IT has grown even further. 
RMIT for me is a university that not only knows exactly what they’re here to teach, but they also allow for me to study in my own way online. I had previously studied at another university for the same degree but quickly learnt that the resources they could offer me would not realistically prepare me to apply my knowledge in the field of IT, this is what brought me to studying at RMIT. 
With the teachings at RMIT I hope to further develop my skills and deepen my knowledge of IT on a broader spectrum to allow me to decide where my skills and interests would best be placed within the vast field of IT. I hope to learns skills that can be applied in a multitude of situations from troubleshooting issues to creating and developing architecture for computer networks.

## Ideal Job

As of right now if someone asked me what my most ideal position or job would be my answer would be software development. Not only will a software development role allow me to express my knowledge in IT but it will also allow me to develop applications and other software that in turn can not just amuse people with a small game but one day be able help other people whether it be helping them do their own jobs or helping them develop skills through learning. Currently I have some basic skills in IT from my 2 years experience working full time as a service desk analyst and hope to further develop my knowledge through online study along side this, with not only a degree under my belt but also years of experience I hope to find a position that will allow me to refine my skills to one day hold the position of a software developer. An example of this position can be found [here](https://www.seek.com.au/job/39147781?type=promoted&searchrequesttoken=8f11aee8-6787-4c45-a099-0f45a1222022) or ![here](https://github.com/InfinityKid/Assignment-1/blob/master/pic5.png)(Mindful Software Pty Ltd, 2019) if the original link has expired;

## Personal Profile

There are many ways you can identify how best you work and develop ideas, two of these are through a Myers-Briggs personality test and a learning style test, these can be found easily online. Below I have included my own results of these two tests along with the results of a third creativity test, these will be discussed further below.

As shown the results offer a great deal of information into how I think and portray ideas, these results mean I can focus myself to environments and work spaces that will best suit me. When working in a team it is always best to convey your ideas to other members of the team, and there are many ways to do this. For myself the most suitable way to convey ideas to others and for others to convey to myself would be through diagrams and visually written documents or messages. Not only will this allow for ideas to be shared among a group but will also provide a way of documenting ideas even if they are not presented in the final product. When I look to form a team for myself it would be best for me to find others who share this same learning style as me but are on varying levels of other results. Creativity is a great thing to have but thinking logically and approaching things from a grounded approach can also offer many solutions and must always be present when doing work in a group.

## Project Idea

### Overview
A project that would fit the role of a software developer is the design and creating of any form of game, game development has many tools available throughout the market but some notable ones include Unity and Unreal Engine two large platforms that offer everything a developer could need to start making their own game.

### Motivation
The gaming industry is one of the worlds largest markets and is growing every day, there is always a demand for all styles of games     from varying types of developers. Once set on a style of game to develop there is still a multitude of possible platforms that this     game can be developed for including game consoles and personal computers. By developing for varying platforms the game will be much     more accessible to a wider audience and have the possibility to grow much further.

### Description
There are many features that are required to make a game work and many more to make it successful, some of the required features include a defined way for players to play the game or learn to play the game through progression. 
Essential game dynamics come in many forms linear progression is a common part of these essential dynamics but has recently become less and less essential. Through a form of progression the game will allow players of all skill levels and knowledge levels to enter the game and pick up all the features as they are unlocked or presented to them over time rather than all at once which can be overwhelming. Once a player is able to navigate the game itself and understands some smaller details a level of difficulty can be added, either through puzzles, sophisticated AI developments or a combination of previously covered game mechanics presented to the user. 
For most of the gaming audience there is a major focus on multiplayer versus modes or competitive leaderboards as this adds the ability to play with more people and push themselves to develop more and more skills within the game environment. These kinds of competitive environment can be implemented by creating timed levels or areas within the game environment to feed into a leaderboard, this method will work much better on games that have higher skill levels and repeatable content such as a story or puzzles. For games with content styled more towards control and management of areas such as tiles in a chess board a multiplayer versus mode where two players can play against eachother would be much more suitable, this could also lead into a leaderboard where wins and losses will provide a gain or loss to a players ranking.

### Tools and Technology
For the development of a game there are a few key requirements to not only make the game but also test the game for possible exploits or bugs that could diminish the user experience. For someone just getting into development an easy starting point would be to use an open source game engine such as Unreal Engine which has complete open source assets for 3D and 2D models along with a functioning way for these to be portrayed into a playable environment.

### Skills Required
For a project of this scale the skills required can vary greatly depending on what the final product is designed as, a detailed open world adventure style game with 3D graphics will require a much greater list of skills such as in depth knowledge of the specific game engine being used and how to create and edit the assets required, whereas a 2D side scrolling game or platformer can be developed by a novice with a basic understanding of coding. Not only is it feasible to complete a project like this at any skill level but the software and hardware required to do so is reachable by almost everyone with many game engines being available as open source and almost any computer being able to run these.

### Outcome
The reason for a project like this isn’t exactly to solve a problem but to engage in an active audience of users and amuse them with the intricacies of a world that has been developed from the ground up. Additionally by developing any form of software especially a game it’s possible to receive constant personal feedback about how different parts of the software interacts and develop solutions to these issues in the future.
