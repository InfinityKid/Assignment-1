# IT and Me

## My Interest

For the early parts of my life I grew up in a household that was always ahead of the curve in technology, from here I developed a keen interest in video games and the devices that ran them. I began following in the footsteps of my dad as he repaired and built many computers eventually reaching today where my interest and love in IT has grown even further. 
RMIT for me is a university that not only knows exactly what they’re here to teach, but they also allow for me to study in my own way online. I had previously studied at another university for the same degree but quickly learnt that the resources they could offer me would not realistically prepare me to apply my knowledge in the field of IT, this is what brought me to studying at RMIT. 
With the teachings at RMIT I hope to further develop my skills and deepen my knowledge of IT on a broader spectrum to allow me to decide where my skills and interests would best be placed within the vast field of IT. I hope to learns skills that can be applied in a multitude of situations from troubleshooting issues to creating and developing architecture for computer networks.

## Ideal Job

As of right now if someone asked me what my most ideal position or job would be my answer would be software development. Not only will a software development role allow me to express my knowledge in IT but it will also allow me to develop applications and other software that in turn can not just amuse people with a small game but one day be able help other people whether it be helping them do their own jobs or helping them develop skills through learning. Currently I have some basic skills in IT from my 2 years experience working full time as a service desk analyst and hope to further develop my knowledge through online study along side this, with not only a degree under my belt but also years of experience I hope to find a position that will allow me to refine my skills to one day hold the position of a software developer. An example of this position can be found [here](https://www.seek.com.au/job/39147781?type=promoted&searchrequesttoken=8f11aee8-6787-4c45-a099-0f45a1222022) or displayed below if the link has expired;
